The Countours architecture is divided into several stages. As a visual guide take the following graph:

The yellow parts are the parts which build the foundation of the Contours framework:
   * The *Contours Grammar* defines the syntax of the custom File Definition. This grammar is taken by the *SableCC* parser generator and creates a parser for the Contours File Definition syntax.
   * The *Logic* is the bunch of code which is attached to the SableCC-generated parser and is responsible for generating a reader for the type of file defined by the user-provided *File Definition*.

The dark blue part is the user-provided part:
   * The *File Definition* contains a description for a specific file format and is provided by the user. The Contours parser takes this definition and generates the *Reader* for these types of file and also the required class-structure for the handling of the read data later on in the users application.
   
The green parts are the ones generated with a specific *File Definition*:
   * The *Reader* is responsible for reading a *Binary File*, analyzing its structure according to the definition and filling the data into the *Data Structure*.
   * The *Data Structure* is composed by hirarchical organized Java classes which build the storage container for the read data from the file. This structure is then available for further processing of the user application.
