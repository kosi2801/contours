The aim of Contours is to provide a framework for Java applications allowing them to extract (binary) data from files. The structures of the files are described in an easy definition language which then gets parsed into a specific file reader for this file format. After processing of a file the contents from it are accessible in a hierarchical Java class structure.

The cornerstones of Contours are
  * easy definition of file formats
  * easy handling of parsed data
  * high reading performance
