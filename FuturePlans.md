# Future Plans #

In the future it is planned to add following features to the Contours framework (no particular order):
  * Near future
    * add javadoc to generated source
    * Conditional parsing (something like a SWITCH on certain values in fields)
    * Additional datatypes
      * Bitfield (to allow access to single bits of the data)
      * terminated strings/array (no fixed size but runs until a certain content, eg. \0x00)
    * Example application with clear build-instructions
  * Far future
    * Generation of bytecode/classes instantly instead of Java-code (get rid of 2-staged compile which is currently needed)
    * Universal file inspector example application
